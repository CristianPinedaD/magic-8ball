# C Magic 8-Ball

This is an implementation of the popular magic 8-ball toy in C (currently just on the terminal, without graphics).
It is in NO way meant to replace traditional decision-making and judgement, it's just a game.

## Installation

Currently, the only way to run the program is by downloading the repo and compiling it on a Unix-like terminal 
using the command:

```bash
  make 
```

You will then run the program by running the command:

```bash
  ./runGame
```

At this time, no pull requests will be approved. This project was made for self-study and practice on some C concepts and 
basic game design. Suggestions are welcome though!
